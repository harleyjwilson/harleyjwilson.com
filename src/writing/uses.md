Here is my list of tech and apps that I use, inspired by Wes Bos's [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/). Have a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/harleyjwilson/dotfiles) to see the configurations for what I use.

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my main code editor.
- My terminal replacement is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com).
- I use [OhMyZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) Zsh framework for the terminal.
- I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.
- I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (with `vim` aliased to `nvim`) for quick edits in the terminal.
- I use the official GitHub CLI [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) as well as [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator for my personal site.

## Desktop Apps

- I switched to [1Password](https://1password.com/) from Lastpass a while ago and couldn't be happier.
- I'm a huge fan of [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) as a Spotlight replacement. This was recommended by [Ali Abdaal](https://twitter.com/aliabdaal).
- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) spaced repetition/flash card application to learn new information. Taking an active approach is more effective then passive reading or note-taking.
- [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) is my inbox for text on all my devices.
- I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) as my distraction free, minimalist markdown editor.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is where my notes are made, worked with, linked and kept.
- [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) is my mail app of choice.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is my task manager of choice. This syncs well with my wife's Todoist account.

## Backup Strategy

- I run a local Time Machine backup to a 2TB Western Digital external drive.
- I use [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) as my offsite backup solution.
- When out and about without internet access I'll use rsync to back up my projects to an USB drive.

## Desk Setup

- I use a [2021 14" M1 Apple Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-space-grey-8-core-cpu-14-core-gpu-512gb).
- I connect my laptop to a [LG 27UP850-W 27" Monitor](https://www.lg.com/au/it-monitors/lg-27up850-w).
- I use a [Logitech K860 Keyboard](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/keyboards/k860-split-ergonomic.920-010111.html) and a [Logitech MX Verticle Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.html) in an effort to look after my wrists.
- I use a pair of [Audio Technica ATH-ANC9 headphones](https://www.amazon.com.au/Technica-ATH-ANC9-Quietpoint-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black/dp/B007KWLF5K). I've had these for a while and have no need to replace them at home yet.
